# Secret Number Game

## About the Project
The **Secret Number Game** is an interactive number-guessing application developed to enhance programming logic skills and event handling with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Created as part of the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) courses, this project demonstrates how fundamental concepts can be applied to build a fun and engaging interactive experience.

## How It Works
1. The system generates a random secret number within a predefined range.
2. The player tries to guess the secret number by entering guesses.
3. The system provides hints to help the player:
   - It indicates whether the secret number is higher or lower than the guess.
4. The game ends when the player guesses the number or decides to give up.

## Project Objectives
The main goal of this project is to teach and reinforce concepts of programming logic and web development, such as:
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
- Control structures (conditionals and loops).
- Data input validation.
- Applying best practices in code organization and structure.

Additionally, the project provides a practical environment to explore creativity and problem-solving skills.

## Future Features
- Difficulty levels: Add easy, medium, and hard options to vary the secret number range.
- Attempts counter: Show how many attempts were made before guessing the number.
- Animations and visual feedback: Make the game more dynamic with animations and visual notifications.
- Multiplayer mode: Allow two players to compete to see who guesses the number first.

## Conclusion
The **Secret Number Game** is more than just a simple game; it is an educational tool that combines fun and learning. It is ideal for beginners who want to consolidate their knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and serves as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.
